# 3DRayTracer

A 3D ray tracer using compute shaders from OpenGL. Goal was to accomplish as realistic as possible renders.
Features:
 - Reflective, diffuse and dielectric materials. 
 - Differently colored spheres and cuboids. 
 - A controllable first person camera.
 - Soft and hard shadows.
 - Anti-aliasing.
 - Multiple differently colored source lights.
 
BDRF takes incoming vector, reflecting it and mixing it with a random vector inside of a hemisphere at the intersection point.
